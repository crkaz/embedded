# Embedded Systems Development
This repository includes the source and documentation for the assessed coursework for the 'Embedded Systems Development', final year module at The University of Hull, 2020. This work was produced as part of a group of 2.

The solution is designed for a PIC QL200 development board, which uses many standard components, to create a 'greenhouse control system'. The system features user input and validation to create a dynamic embedded application that sounds an alarm when the ambient temperature exceeds user-defined thresholds.
