This repository includes the source and documentation for the assessed coursework for the 'Embedded Systems Development', final year module at The University of Hull, 2020.

The solution is designed for a PIC QL200 development board, which uses many standard components, to create a 'greenhouse control system'. The system features user input and validation to create a dynamic embedded application that sounds an alarm when the ambient temperature exceeds user-defined thresholds.
